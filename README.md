# Project 05 - FPS Maze

April 10th, 2021
This is a basic FPS maze with various implementations for my Project 05.

## Implementations

The key I used is from the Kenney.nl "Platformer Kit" (https://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-kit)

The Zombie character is from the Kenney.nl "Blocky Characters" kit (https://kenney.nl/assets/blocky-characters)

Both the sound when picking up the key, and the noise the zombie makes are from Freesound.org.
  Key sound = "Coins 1" (https://freesound.org/people/ProjectsU012/sounds/341695/)
  Zombie sound = "Zombie Snarl" (https://freesound.org/people/gneube/sounds/315844/)
  
The music that plays is Patrickdeartega.com's "Solve The Puzzle" (https://patrickdearteaga.com/royalty-free-music/solve-the-puzzle/)
